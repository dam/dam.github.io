## About Damien Imberdis

I am a software engineer with experience working on web applications (Front & Backend). I have worked as a consultant in Paris during 3 years and in startups in Ottawa during 4 years. I love learning about programming languages and new technologies. I am actually going deeper in functional programming and learning Big Data. If I am not coding, I like travelling, watching sport games, reading technical and philosophical books.

After an engineer degree in electronic and computer sciences, I learn Web development and Agile methodologies in [Kantena](http://kantena.com), Paris. That was the first launching stage for my career and since that time, I am always focused on writing better code and get the things done.

I moved to Canada in 2012 and worked with incredible persons that gave me a new vision for my career. I learned more fields (Front-End development, DevOps, Big Data...) and read a lot about freelancing, entrepreneurship, be healthier. 

My children born in July 2015 and July 2017are a big change in my life. They give me a lot of energy and love day after day.
